### Review recommended

🟨 **Recommended** — warnings detected with high severity or confidence.

### Top actions

- **High-entropy secret/token pattern detected** — Risk: Secret/token exposure risk. High-entropy string or token pattern detected.
Reason: Diff contains 20+ character high-entropy string or AWS key/JWT token/base64-like pattern. This may be a secret/token.
Suggested action: Verify nothing is hardcoded and nothing leaks to logs. Move secrets to environment variables or secure storage. If it's test data, use mock/placeholder.
- **Possible architecture layer violation** — Violation direction: presentation -> domain, core -> feature

Why this rule exists: Multiple architecture layer violations detected. Clean Architecture controls inter-layer dependencies to improve code maintainability and testability. Layer violations cause tight coupling and ripple effects when making changes.

What to do: According to Clean Architecture principles, presentation layer can depend on domain layer, but this should typically be through domain abstractions like use cases or entities. Direct dependency on domain implementations may violate architectural boundaries.
- **Large diff might be risky to review/performance** — Diff is large (+2245/-2627, total 4872 lines). Splitting into smaller PRs may improve review quality and risk management.
- **Large change set might be hard to review** — High number of changed files (75). Splitting into smaller PRs may improve review quality.
- **UI changes may benefit from golden tests** — UI components changed. Consider adding golden/widget tests to lock down critical screens.
